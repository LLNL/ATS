Sample use of lightweight ATS wrapper script

How to use:

    export PATH=/usr/gapps/ats/toss_3_x86_64_ib/7.0.105/bin:$PATH
    (or put the python with ATS you are working on in your upath, wherever that is)

    ats_hello               <- Lightweight wrapper to ATS for your project
    hello_ats.c             <- Simple executable -- will be your projects exectuable(s)
    create_test_ats.py      <- Python script which will create the test.ats file
                               Enables projects to easily create tests with
                               variable number of MPI processes, code executables,
                               code arguments (test decks, etc), sandbox options,
                               and post test checkers.

Compile hello_ats.c with an mpi C wrapper, such as mpigcc or mpiicc, creating
an a.out executable in this directory like so:

    mpicc hello_ats.c

Run the ats_hello wrapper script like so:

    ./ats_hello

If run from a login node (such as Alastor), it will run tests which pass and
fail, as well as checker scripts, some which pass, fail, are skipped.

The end of the run should inclde:

FAILED:  12 a(a.out_1), a(a.out_3), etc.
PASSED:   18
SKIPPED:  14

It may also present some which are HALTED if errors are detected in slurm
or mpi init by ATS.

-- Flux testing notes (2019-Sep-06) from SAD
-- Flux testing is not working at this time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the ats_hello script one will run, search for 'Flux testing' to see comments
on the current state of flux.

There is a flux_direct.py module coded up by a developer with assistance from
Tom Scogland.  One may use this module by uncommenting this line in the ats_hello
script

    os.environ['MACHINE_TYPE'] = "flux"

ATS will then use this wrapper, as evidenced by the lines put to stdout:

    from flux_direct import FluxDirect as Machine

But the import of flux fails.  This is where we need to start the work.  Update
the flux_direct.py file so that it can import flux. Then move on from there to
make flux work.

--  Notes on running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* If run from a front end node, the ats_hello script will salloc 1 nodes and
  run within that allocation.  If there are not 4 nodes available in the debug
  queue, it will stall until nodes are available.  See following notes for
  other options.

* One may override the number of nodes to be used via the --numNodes option
to ats_hello like so: ./ats_hello --numNodes=.2

* ats_hello --help will show all options.

* One may pre-allocate a set of nodes, and run ats_hello with that allocation.
  One way to allocate 2 nodes on chaos and reserve all the cores for your
  use for testing would be:

  salloc -N2 -n2 -p pdebug --exclusive

  Remember to exit and free the reserved nodes when done testing.

* The sample test case runs parallel jobs up to 64 processors.  If one runs
  in an allocation that has less than the number of processors, then those
  jobs will be skipped, but others will run.

* This is just a sample to get one started. There are many other ways to run,
   more checkers can be specified, more ATS options, etc.

* Contact Shawn Dawson for feedback and for questions about using ATS on your project
